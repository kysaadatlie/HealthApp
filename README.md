# HealthApp
Desktop app that calculates the calories. 

The first window is a Login window:

For Nurlan agai, I created the username "nurlan" and password "777".

Then, the main window opens:

Here, click "profile" button to calculate the AMR (Active Metabolic Rate, which is the total number of calories you would need in order to maintain your weight every day.)

When the "Home" button is presssed, you go back to the main window. If "+" button is clicked, the add food window opens:

You can choose the food item and amount. Then if you click "Add" button, it will calculate the total amount of the calories. The calories in the table are calculated per serving size.
If you click "home" button, you'll go back to the main window.

As you add the food, you need to press the "Update" button to see what you ate on the main table. Thus, you can check what you eat per day, week, month, etc:

Also, there are "About" and "Help" menu items in the menu bar:

I think, the database implementation (like MySQL) would improve the functionality of this app :)
